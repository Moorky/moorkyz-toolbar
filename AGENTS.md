# AGENTS.md - Moorkyz Tools

## Product and authority

This repository is a modular tools portal with independently usable local tools.
The user explicitly replaced the former SDK product on 2026-10-23: retain only
a small standalone Toolbar Builder, remove the legacy SDK/Studio/examples and
active specifications, and preserve Git history and existing audit records.
See [current decisions](docs/decisions/decision-register.md). Historical audits
describe older revisions and are not current product requirements.

## Required practice

- Inspect the existing implementation and relevant documentation before edits.
- Keep tools independent. Portal navigation must not depend on an individual tool.
- Preserve accessibility, keyboard operation, reduced motion, strict typing,
  CSP-safe rendering, local-first data handling and explicit error reporting.
- Local services are opt-in, loopback-only and inactive while disabled. Do not
  introduce hosted file processing, accounts, telemetry or background connections.
- Directory Cleaner always archives "deleted" files. Preview is non-mutating;
  changes require explicit confirmation, revalidation and a recoverable receipt.
  Never overwrite files, follow symlinks/junctions, or clean a filesystem root.
- Use isolated temporary fixtures, never real personal files, for tests. Do not
  auto-install native tools or alter shared machine prerequisites.
- No new mandatory dependencies, permission/data handling changes, public hosting,
  publishing, deployment, signing, spending or external integration without approval.
- Preserve unrelated work. Stage only task-owned paths. After applicable checks
  pass, create a filled task-specific audit from `docs/audits/TEMPLATE.md` and one
  focused local commit including it. Never push or rewrite history without approval.
- Report exact commands and observed `PASS`, `FAIL`, `NOT RUN` or `N/A`; a
  self-audit is not independent security or accessibility certification.

## Structure and commands

- `packages/portal`: Next.js/React catalog, shared detail/source views and small
  per-tool workspaces. `tools/`: standalone scripts/services and explicit source
  bundle allowlists. `tests/`: retained generic tooling and current tool tests.
- Register tools in `packages/portal/src/data/tools.ts`. Generated source JSON/ZIP
  assets are built from allowlists; never include history, media, secrets or caches.
- `pnpm build`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm format:check`, `pnpm typecheck`,
  `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:browser`, `pnpm check:source`, `pnpm check`.
- `pnpm tool:videocrunch`, `pnpm tool:directory-cleaner` start explicit local
  services. Read their setup pages before enabling portal connections.
- `.\moorkyz.cmd help`, `.\moorkyz.cmd doctor`, `.\moorkyz.cmd audit "task title"`
  remain generic repository management commands.
