# tools.moorkyz.com CLI for Local Repository Work

The repository includes a dependency-free Node.js helper for local project lifecycle, package scripts, and task-audit file creation. It is maintainer tooling, not a public tool or SDK consumer CLI.

## Commands available now

From the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd help
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd doctor
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd start
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd status
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd logs
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd stop
.\tools.moorkyz.com.cmd audit "task title"
```

On macOS/Linux, use `sh ./tools.moorkyz.com`. The `audit` command creates an unfilled report from `docs/audits/TEMPLATE.md`; fill in observed evidence before considering the task complete.

`tools.moorkyz.com.config.json` selects `packages/portal` as the default project, using its `dev` script for `start` and its `start` script for `start --prod`. The portal prefers `http://localhost:3001`; if that port is occupied, the CLI selects the next available port and records the runtime URL. The production command requires a prior portal build.

After `start` or `restart` succeeds, the CLI opens the actual runtime URL in the default browser in
an interactive terminal. Lifecycle, list, and status output show the recorded runtime URL. Browser
launching is skipped in CI and non-interactive sessions.
Starting a project that is already running replaces its existing CLI-managed instance first;
unrelated processes are left running.

The CLI also supports `restart`, `verify`, `build`, `test`, `lint`, `typecheck`, `security`, and `run`. Package-check commands require the selected package to define the requested script.

The workspace configuration is intentionally scoped to the portal. Use the named-project argument only if further projects are later added to this configuration.

## Safety

- Run commands from the intended repository root. The helper operates on the current working directory.
- It does not install packages, modify package manifests, deploy, publish, or commit.
- Managed process state and logs live in `.tools.moorkyz.com/`, which is ignored by `.gitignore`. The helper will stop only verified processes it started; inspect an unverified stale state instead of deleting it blindly.
- `start --prod` runs an existing local production script; it is not deployment.
- No global PowerShell profile installer is included. Use the explicit repository-local launcher.
- `security` is a read-only package advisory check when a compatible package manifest and package manager are available; it does not prove dependencies safe or update them.
