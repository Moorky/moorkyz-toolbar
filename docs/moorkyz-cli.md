# Moorkyz CLI, Local Project Management

> Portable and dependency-free JavaScript CLI for the approved Node.js runtime. No application code or project-specific architecture is bundled.

## Setup

Prerequisites: the project's approved Node.js runtime (Node.js 24 LTS for the shared baseline),
the package-manager version in `package.json`, and a `package.json` containing the scripts you
intend to run. Maintenance and archival commands also work in repositories without a package
manifest. Keep `moorkyz.cjs` and `moorkyz-storage.cjs` together when copying the CLI.

**Windows / PowerShell** (from the repository containing these starter files):

```powershell
.\moorkyz.cmd help
# Optional one-time installation of a shell function so `moorkyz` works in every project folder:
& .\install-moorkyz.ps1
. $PROFILE
moorkyz help
```

The optional installer edits **only the current user's PowerShell profile**, creating a function pointing at this CLI file; it does not change the system PATH. Keep this CLI file in place after installing. To remove the function, run `& .\install-moorkyz.ps1 -Uninstall`, then restart PowerShell. If PowerShell blocks scripts by policy, use `.\moorkyz.cmd` directly; don't weaken the system execution policy just to install the shortcut.

Two Windows details worth knowing:

- Downloaded starter files carry an internet zone marker, so `RemoteSigned` policy rejects the unsigned installer. Trust that one file instead of changing the policy: `Unblock-File .\install-moorkyz.ps1`, then run the installer again.
- Each PowerShell host keeps its own profile. Install once per host you use, for example `powershell.exe -File .\install-moorkyz.ps1` for Windows PowerShell 5.1 and `pwsh -File .\install-moorkyz.ps1` for PowerShell 7+.

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
chmod +x ./moorkyz
./moorkyz help
# Optional current-shell command for use from other project folders:
moorkyz() { node /absolute/path/to/moorkyz.cjs "$@"; }
```

To persist the function, put it in your appropriate shell initialization file and replace `/absolute/path/to` with the true path. The CLI always operates on the **current working directory**.

Lifecycle commands use installed dependencies. `moorkyz install` explicitly runs a reproducible
install; it requires a reviewed lockfile and never generates a replacement lockfile. Database
migrations, production deployment and Git operations remain separate project workflows.

## Package managers

The nearest ancestor `package.json` with an explicit `packageManager` is authoritative. Otherwise,
the CLI detects `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` in the project or its ancestors
inside the repository. Multiple competing lockfiles require an explicit `packageManager`.
Projects with no declaration or lockfile retain the pnpm default. The selected tool must already be
installed; `doctor` reports detected and declared versions. Tool/version and script lookups are
cached within a command invocation.

Reproducible installs use `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `npm ci`, Yarn Classic's
`yarn install --frozen-lockfile`, or modern Yarn's `yarn install --immutable`. The install runs at
the selected manager's root; scripts run in the configured project's directory. npm script options
are passed after `--`. Security checks use the manager's native audit; modern Yarn includes all
workspaces and transitive dependencies. Audit severity/exit semantics differ across manager versions;
these checks report the tool's real exit status and never apply upgrades.

## Default single-project mode

With no `moorkyz.config.json`, one root project named `default` is assumed, running the detected
manager's `dev` script for `start` and `start` script for `start --prod`. The requested script must
exist in `package.json`; a documentation or coordination repository does not acquire a fabricated
web server. Production mode sets `NODE_ENV=production` as well as the selected `PORT`.

## Named projects / monorepos

Copy `moorkyz.config.example.json` to `moorkyz.config.json`, then update the project names, paths and existing script names. Example:

```json
{
  "defaultProject": "web",
  "projects": {
    "web": { "cwd": "apps/web", "dev": "dev", "prod": "start", "url": "http://localhost:3000" },
    "worker": { "cwd": "apps/worker", "dev": "dev", "prod": "start", "url": "http://localhost:3001" }
  }
}
```

- `moorkyz start` starts the configured `defaultProject`.
- `moorkyz start all` launches every configured project.
- After `start` or `restart` succeeds, each selected project's URL opens in the default browser.
  This is skipped in CI and non-interactive sessions.
- The selected port is saved in `.moorkyz/<name>.preferences.json`. Every start checks
  it again, then tries the configured URL's port, a project-specific candidate, and up to 64 random
  ports in 10000–49151. Both IPv4 and IPv6 loopback are checked in parallel. A global port lock
  and live state reservations separate simultaneous starts. No unprivileged CLI can reserve a port
  permanently: a process can still claim it between the probe and application bind. Detected
  `EADDRINUSE` startup failures retry up to three total attempts with another port.
- The runtime URL is saved and shown by lifecycle, list, and status output after stopping too.
  Configure `url` for a different default; changing it invalidates the previous preference.
- The CLI sets `PORT` and recognizes Vite/Astro scripts, passing their `--port` argument.
  Other servers can use `"portArgs": ["--port", "{port}"]` in their project settings. Arguments
  are constrained to safe CLI tokens. `startupTimeoutMs` defaults to 20000 (allowed: 1000–300000).
  Startup success requires a verified supervisor heartbeat and a TCP listener, not an HTTP health
  response; use application/container health checks for production readiness.
- Starting a project that is already running replaces its existing CLI-managed instance first;
  unrelated processes are left running.
- `moorkyz logs worker --follow` follows one project's output.
- If multiple projects are configured without a default, specify a project name.

## Safety and operational behavior

- Background processes are supervised and recorded under `.moorkyz/`, which must remain Git-ignored.
  Runtime state, preferences, lock files and log paths refuse symlinks/junctions. Corrupt tracking
  JSON stops the operation with an actionable error and preserves existing state.
- Lifecycle commands serialize operations for each project using
  `.moorkyz/<project>.lock.json`. State and heartbeats are published atomically;
  `stop` requires the recorded token, supervisor PID and fresh heartbeat to match.
  An alive but unverified supervisor keeps its tracking state and requires
  inspection before another service is started or stopped.
- A forcibly killed CLI can leave a lock. Inspect the recorded owner PID and
  confirm that no lifecycle command is active before manually removing that
  exact project lock; the CLI does not reclaim it automatically. If upgrading
  a running older CLI, stop its services with that version first: old heartbeats
  do not carry the PID required by the new verification.
- Unix stopping sends SIGTERM to the tracked process group. Windows stopping uses `taskkill /PID ... /T /F` on the verified supervisor tree; graceful shutdown behavior therefore differs by platform.
- If an application forks into an unrelated process group or daemonizes itself, the CLI may not control the detached descendants. Don't use the CLI as a production process manager.
- Running `start --prod` invokes an existing production script **locally**; it is not a deployment command.
- Each start creates `logs/log_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-mmm.log` using UTC and exclusive creation to
  avoid collisions. The preference file records the service's latest log. Older `.moorkyz/<name>.log`
  files remain readable for compatibility; the CLI does not rewrite their contents.
- `moorkyz security` checks known advisories but does not update dependencies. Dependabot handles automatic update PRs (see `docs/dependency-security.md`).
- `moorkyz audit` generates an **unfilled** template; the agent must record real verification evidence before committing.
- The PowerShell installer validates unique, ordered management markers before
  editing. It writes the profile atomically as UTF-8 with a BOM so Windows
  PowerShell 5.1 preserves non-ASCII text. Uninstalling an absent function leaves
  the file untouched. Regression tests use disposable profiles and never edit
  the developer's real profile.

## Logs, trash and compressed archives

Keep `/logs/`, `/archive/`, `/trash/` and `/.moorkyz/` ignored by Git and Docker. These directories
are local runtime data; do not add tracked `.gitkeep` files inside them. The CLI creates them when needed.

The root `logs/` directory retains at most 50 canonical log files (or the lower configured
`storage.maxLogs`). Invalid names and expired logs from one maintenance pass are compressed together
in one ZIP before removal. Running services' logs are protected; starting another service fails
with a clear message if active services occupy the entire cap. Maintenance runs before each start,
every 30 seconds while a supervised service runs, and with `moorkyz maintain`. A filesystem folder
cannot reject arbitrary writes by other programs: external writers must use the shared helper or
run maintenance, so the cap is eventually enforced between checks. Symlinks are refused and left
for inspection rather than followed into another folder.

Long-running application loggers should call `registerLog(projectRoot, logPath)` after creating a
canonical file with `createLog(projectRoot)` and retain the returned release callback. Shared
maintenance automatically protects live PID leases in `.moorkyz/log-leases/`, even when a different
CLI or application runs it. Call the callback after closing the log stream; dead process leases are
cleaned automatically. A reused PID conservatively keeps its old log protected until inspection.
Callers should run maintenance before opening a new log and periodically while running.
Use `maintainStorage(root, { reserveLogs: 1 })` before creating the next managed log to make room
without temporarily exceeding the cap.

Place disposable project files in `trash/`, then run `moorkyz maintain` to compress all staged
items as a batch. Routine background maintenance rotates logs; explicit maintenance also empties
staged trash. Files deleted by an editor, OS command or unrelated tool cannot be intercepted by this
CLI. Route deletions that need recovery through `moorkyz archive` or its code API:

```js
const { archivePaths, maintainStorage } = require("./moorkyz-storage.cjs");
await archivePaths(process.cwd(), ["generated/report.json", "old-assets"]);
await maintainStorage(process.cwd(), { includeTrash: true });
```

`archivePaths` accepts `{ remove: false }` for copy-only backups. Use the CLI to serialize concurrent
operations, or serialize library calls in your application. Archive names are
`archive/log_yyyy-mm-dd-hh-mm-ss-mmm.zip`, even for one file. Entries preserve relative paths, UTF-8
names, file permissions and empty directories. Compression streams with bounded buffers; classic
ZIP limits (less than 4 GiB per file/archive and at most 65534 entries) fail safely before removal.
Every ZIP is flushed and decompressed to verify CRC32 and SHA-256 before source removal. Source
identity and content are checked again before unlinking; directories are removed only when empty.
The project root, Git metadata, runtime state, archive directory, symlinks/junctions and special files
cannot be selected. Stop writers before archiving mutable data: simultaneous changes can leave
sources in place or a partly removed batch whose verified ZIP still contains the original bytes.
The helper is not a security sandbox against another process racing filesystem operations.
In-progress archive PID leases prevent a concurrent maintenance process from pruning a ZIP while
its source-removal step is still running.

Free-space checks use the archive directory's filesystem. Defaults trigger retention below the
greater of 1 GiB free or 5% free, then delete oldest canonical ZIPs until the greater of 2 GiB or
10% free is reached. Configure `minFreeBytes`, `targetFreeBytes`, `minFreePercent` and
`targetFreePercent` under `storage` in `moorkyz.config.json`; targets must meet or exceed their
minimums. Only regular canonical ZIP files in this project's `archive/` are eligible. Newly created
archives are protected for their current maintenance run. If removing eligible archives cannot
reach the threshold, maintenance reports low space; project source files and other folders are
never pruned. Archived recovery data may be permanently removed by this policy, so keep durable
backups outside the project archive. Archives are compressed, not encrypted.

The Node-core regression suite is portable: `node --test tests/tooling/moorkyz-runtime.node.cjs`.
The repository's existing tooling tests also exercise the supervised process lifecycle and installer.
